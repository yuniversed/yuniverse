Too many years of unhealthy eating, free food at work and not monitoring my intake has had me gain nearly 40 lbs from my lows around 160lbs around 2012.  Time to seriously get back on the train.

* Keto all the way! I have found that keto definitely levels out my hunger so that I'm not painfully craving food after a short period of time.
* Each month, I'll re-evaluate calories and progress.  First checkpoint is the end of January (aiming for ~193lbs)

{{< gsheet >}}

* Red line is 1% weight loss per week
* Green line is 0.5% weight loss per week
* Yellow line is 'actual value' with 6 day moving average
