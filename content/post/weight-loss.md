Nearly a decade ago, I lost over 70 lbs through a combination of exercise, eating moderation and keto. In the 7 or 8 years since hitting personal lows around 160lbs, injury and life caught up to me.  I've not seriously focused on weight loss for quite a few years now -- but that changes this year!

* Eating low carb (keto) helps me manage hunger pangs.  I find it much easier to reach lower calorie targets when carb consumption is low.
* Intermittent fasting helps to control the amount of calories I am taking in.  16:8 fasting is probably the most common at this point - essentially skipping breakfast and ending dinner around 8pm.
